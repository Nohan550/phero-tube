      <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium">1.The scope of var, let, and const :</h2>
      <br />

      <p class="text-xl font-light">
        In JavaScript, "var", "let", and "const" are used to declare variables,
        but they have different scopes and behaviors. Understanding their scope
        is crucial for writing clean and error-free JavaScript code. Let's
        discuss the scope of each: <br /><br />

        <span class="font-medium">'var':</span><br /><br />

        Function Scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning
        they are only accessible within the function in which they are declared.
        <br />
        Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their
        containing function or global scope, which means they can be used before
        they are declared, but their value will be undefined until assigned.
        <br /><br /><br />

        <span class="font-medium">'let':</span><br /><br />

        Block Scope: Variables declared with let have block scope, meaning they
        are only accessible within the block (i.e., any pair of curly braces {})
        in which they are defined. <br />
        Hoisting: Variables declared with let are hoisted to the top of their
        containing block but are not initialized, so attempting to use them
        before declaration will result in a Reference. <br /><br /><br />

        <span class="font-medium">'const':</span> <br /><br />

        Block Scope: Like let, variables declared with const also have block
        scope. Constant Value: Variables declared with const must be initialized
        with a value when declared, and this value cannot be changed or
        reassigned after initialization. However, the object or array they
        reference is not immutable, so their properties or elements can be
        modified. <br />
        Hoisting: Variables declared with const are hoisted, but they are not
        initialized, so like let, attempting to use them before declaration
        results in a ReferenceError.

        2.The use cases of null and undefined:
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p class="text-xl font-light">
        <span class="font-medium">'null':</span> <br /><br />

        Explicitly Empty Value: null is often used to represent an explicitly
        empty value or the absence of any object value. It's typically assigned
        to variables or properties to indicate that there is no valid object or
        value present. <br />
        <br />
        Initialization: You can initialize a variable with null when you want to
        indicate that it hasn't been assigned a meaningful value yet.
        <br /><br /><br />

        <span class="font-medium">'undefined':</span> <br /><br />

        Implicitly Empty Value: 'undefined' is used to represent the absence of
        a value or a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned
        any value. It's the default value for function parameters that are not
        provided during a function call. <br /><br />
        Accessing Non-existent Properties: When you try to access an object
        property that doesn't exist, the result is undefined. <br /><br />
        Return Value: Functions that do not explicitly return a value will
        return undefined by default.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium">3.What does it mean by REST API?</h2>
      <br />
      <p class="text-xl font-light">
        REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application
        Programming Interface. It is a set of architectural principles and
        constraints used for designing networked applications. REST is not a
        protocol but rather a set of guidelines and best practices for creating
        web services that are scalable, stateless, and can be easily consumed by
        clients. <br /><br />

        Here are the key principles and characteristics of RESTful APIs:
        <br /><br />

        <span class="font-medium"> 1. Stateless:</span> Each request from a
        client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand
        and process the request. The server should not rely on any previous
        requests. This makes it easier to scale the server and handle a large
        number of clients. <br /><br />

        <span class="font-medium">2. Client-Server Architecture:</span> REST
        separates the client from the server, allowing them to evolve
        independently. This separation of concerns makes it easier to develop
        and maintain both client and server components. <br /><br />

        <span class="font-medium">3. Uniform Interface:</span> REST APIs have a
        consistent and uniform interface, which typically includes standard HTTP
        methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
        operations. Resources are identified using URLs, and HTTP status codes
        are used to indicate the result of an operation. <br /><br />

        <span class="font-medium">4. Resource-Based:</span> Resources, such as
        data objects or services, are represented as URIs (Uniform Resource
        Identifiers). These resources can be manipulated using standard HTTP
        methods. <br />
        <br />

        <span class="font-medium">5. Representation</span>: Resources can have
        multiple re presentations, such as JSON, XML, HTML, or others. Clients
        can specify their preferred representation using HTTP headers (e.g.,
        Accept) or receive the default representation. <br /><br />

        <span class="font-medium">6. Statelessness:</span> Each request from a
        client to a server must be self-contained and not rely on any server
        state that is not part of the request itself. Session information, if
        needed, is typically maintained on the client side. <br />
        <br />

        <span class="font-medium">7. Layered System:</span> REST allows for a
        layered system architecture, where various components (e.g., load
        balancers, caching servers, security layers) can be added between the
        client and the server without affecting the overall system's
        functionality. <br />
        <br />

        <span class="font-medium">8. Cacheability:</span> Responses from the
        server can be cached by clients to improve performance, provided that
        the server indicates whether a response is cacheable or not using
        appropriate HTTP headers. <br />
        <br />

        RESTful APIs are widely used in web development and are the foundation
        for many web services and applications. They make it easy to build
        scalable and interoperable systems, as they leverage the existing HTTP
        infrastructure and are independent of programming languages and
        platforms. Regenerate
